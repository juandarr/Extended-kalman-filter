# Extended Kalman Filter 

This repository contains the code of an Enhanced Kalman Filter implementation to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. The C++ code creates a server with uWebSockets and connects to a client simulator built on the Unity engine. The simulator shows the moving object, laser/radar/estimation data (as red dots, blue circles and green triangles respectively) and RMSE data for position and velocity values in the x and y axis.

The Simulator (Client) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF


The main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator is:


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]
